Thanks for using the Converter, here are some instructions (See https://github.com/mist475/LotrModConverter_Public for full instructions with images)
This Converter only handles Playerdata and World settings, the world itself is not yet supported


1 - Create a new world in Renewed (create a world in 1.16.5 with the LOTR mod installed)
2 - Copy your old world to the same folder as the world you just created
3 - Unzip the zipfile this file is in and place the created folder in the same folder as the worlds mentioned above
4 - If you want to change some settings, Open the Conversions.json file and go to the Settings section
Because the world itself doesn't convert yet, the setting to set every player to creative mode by default is on,
if you're a server owner or want to be bold you can turn this off
5 - Run the converter, if you're on Windows, run the .bat file, if you're on Linux/macOS, run the converter via the command line (should work, tested on linux)
	- If multiple worlds are found, a selection menu will appear, select the world you want converted
	- If multiple renewed world are found, a similar selection menu will appear
If the program crashed:
	- Please set "Debug Messages" to 2 in the Json file
	- Run the converter again
	- Copy the everything the program printed except pathnames (C://your name/...) and send it to me on the #Help channel of my Discord server (discord:rppMgSHaTe)
Else:
6 - Open the world in Renewed, the world name will be the same as the old world, the folder name will be named $worldname_Converted
7 - Enjoy Renewed, if an item was deleted that is present on Renewed or something appears to be off please tell me
